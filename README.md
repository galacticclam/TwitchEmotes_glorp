1. Create a CurseForge API token and enter it in this file: `CURSEFORGE_API_TOKEN=...`
1. Update the version number in `TwitchEmotes_glorp-Mainline.toc` and `TwitchEmotes_glorp-Classic.toc`

    * Size must be a power of 2, otherwise you'll see green squares for your emote
    * The default size is 32. Only go higher for real-life pictures
